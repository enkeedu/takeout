# Web Presence MVP Plan

## Scope
- Web presence only
- No ordering
- No voice AI
- No POS integrations

## Objectives
- Auto-publish high-quality restaurant pages for the directory
- Keep pages SEO-safe, unique, and structured
- Convert owners with a simple claim + upgrade flow

## URL Strategy
- Canonical restaurant detail pages: `brand.com/state/city/restaurant-name`
- Cuisine landing pages: `brand.com/cuisine/chinese/state/city`
- Canonical tag on restaurant pages always points to the restaurant detail URL

## Templates (Phase 1)
- Modern Clean
- Warm Editorial
- Bold Street

Layouts are fixed. AI only fills content slots and selects theme + typography.

## AI Content (Guardrailed)
Inputs
- Name, address, phone, hours, cuisine, neighborhood
- Owner uploads and highlights

Guardrails
- No claims outside provided data
- Safe fallback copy if data is thin

## Owner Uploads

Owner inputs override AI output.

## Claim and Upgrade
